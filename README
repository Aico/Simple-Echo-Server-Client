This project contains an echo server and an asynchronous client 
both written in C, used to send echo messages to the echo server.
The client uses the time elapse between the sent and received 
messages to compute the:
1. Round trip time for each echo message.
2. Average round trip time.
3. Throughput rate for all messages.

Tests written in Python are supplied to test the Client and Server 
for your system.

Compiling:
Just type "make" in the directory where the makefile is.

Running the server:
Usage: server <Server Port>
Example: ./server 5000
to start the server listening on port 5000.

Running the client:
Usage: client <Server Address> <Repeat times> [<Server Port>]
Example: ./client 127.0.0.1 5 5000
to start the client and send 5 echo messages to port 5000 of 
the localhost. If port is not supplied it is set to the
default echo port of 7.

Running the tests:
python ./tests.py
